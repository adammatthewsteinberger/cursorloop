# cursorloop

Autonomous Cursor Agent session runner (Composer-first; Grok as a secondary model profile). Same job as [claudeloop](https://github.com/adammatthewsteinberger/claudeloop): never block on a human, and never treat billing exhaustion as a waitable rate-limit window.

**Status:** planning only. Product source is not scaffolded yet.
